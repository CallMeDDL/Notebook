# Programming

## Data Structure
0. Tree
* DFS(Stack) and BFS(Queue), Iterative and recursive
* Segment tree

## Underlying Algorithm
0. Graph
* Union find, Disjoint set
* Topological sort

1. Dynamic Programming
* Simplify a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time
* Usually used to improve DFS and solve special NP problem in polynomial time
* DFS with memorization is equal to DP algorithm

## Heuristic Algorithm
0. Minimax Algorithm:
* When dealing with gains, it is referred to as "maximin"â€”to maximize the minimum gain.
* Improvement: alpha-beta pruning and Monte Carlo tree search
